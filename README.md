# Nothing-happened (Work in Progress)

**nothing-happened** is a package inspired by Zoroâ€™s calm endurance of pain and his iconic phrase, "nothing happened." This package will silently clean your imperfect codeâ€”removing unused code, comments, and clutterâ€”leaving only a sharp, clean codebase. Once cleaned, the changes will be pushed to a branch named `nothing-happened`, as if nothing ever happened.

## ðŸš§ Development in Progress

This package is still under development. We are working hard to bring the core features to life, and we appreciate your patience.

## Features (Planned)

- **Silent Cleanup**: Remove unused code, comments, and unnecessary files.
- **Codebase Refinement**: Clean your repo without any drama, leaving only essential code.
- **Effortless Operation**: Run the package with a simple command and let it handle the cleanup.
- **Customizable**: Plan to support scheduled cleanups or manual triggers.
- **Branch Cleanup**: Once the cleanup is done, the changes will be pushed to a new branch called `nothing-happened`.

## Installation (Not Yet Available)

Once published, youâ€™ll be able to install **nothing-happened** via npm:

```bash
npm install nothing-happened
```

## Usage (Not Yet Available)

Weâ€™ll provide detailed usage instructions once the package is ready for release. The basic command will look something like this:

```bash
nothing-happened clean
```

After running the command, a new branch named `nothing-happened` will be created, and all clean changes will be pushed to it.

## Why "nothing-happened"?

Just as Zoro endures challenges with a stoic "nothing happened," **nothing-happened** will take on the burden of cleaning up your messy code. It quietly removes unused code and clutter, leaving your repository pristine, as if nothing ever happened. The result will be pushed to a branch named `nothing-happened`â€”because thatâ€™s how clean and effortless the process is.
