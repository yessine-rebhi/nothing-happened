  "description": "**nothing-happened** is a package inspired by Zoro’s calm endurance of pain and his iconic phrase, \"nothing happened.\" This package will silently clean your imperfect code—removing unused code, comments, and clutter—leaving only a sharp, clean codebase. Once cleaned, the changes will be pushed to a branch named `nothing-happened`, as if nothing ever happened.",
